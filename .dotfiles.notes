Notes on moving various dotfiles

~/.esd_auth – pointless
  - PulseAudio modules accept an auth-cookie= argument
  - however, ESD itself hardcodes $HOME/.esd_auth

~/.gdbinit – hardcoded

~/.gemrc – environment
  - hardcoded, but $GEMRC can have a list of /additional/ rc's

~/.gstreamer-0.10/ – partial
  - the registry can use $GST_REGISTRY (which has to be overridden to its
    original value for 1.0 with $GST_REGISTRY_1_0)
  - but presets are not possible to move, so I don't bother at all.

~/.gtkrc-2.0 – environment
  - $GTK2_RC_FILES can have a list of rc's

~/.ICEauthority – environment
  - ICEAUTHORITY="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ICE-auhority"

~/.mtoolsrc – environment
  - $MTOOLSRC can point to an additional rc

~/.netrc – fixed
  - many apps expect it there

~/.offlineimaprc – command line only
  - the only method is `offlineimap -c <path>`

~/.wgetrc – hardcoded

~/.Xkbmap – hardcoded
  - hardcoded in /etc/gdm/Xsession (although GNOME uses dconf)

# vim: ts=4 sw=4 et tw=79
